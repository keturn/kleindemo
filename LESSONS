Lessons learned from this:

- Trailing slashes on routes are important!  A request for /static/foo.css
  will be handled by a route for '/static/' but not '/static'.

- Returning File('static/main.html') doesn't work, due to the one open bug
  klein has right now: https://github.com/twisted/klein/issues/2
  Currently our handler for / is working around that by reading the file
  itself.

- Calling request.write() after the client has disconnected does not produce
  an error.  There is no deferred or other return value from write().  In
  commit 7aef2aef we check request.transport.disconnected, but it might be
  more proper to use request.notifyFinish.

- I got the server to start on AppFog by using the Standalone Python framework
  and having the server listen on the port VCAP_APP_PORT, but it the Server-
  Sent Events requests didn't go through.
