* Publish moves through the event source
- keep a list of connections

* Render moves on client

* Send moves to the server
- write server method (log data only)
- write javascript post method

* Deploy
- get repeatable deployment script (requirements.txt?)
- set up hosting account
- deploy on account

- maybe use subdomain for eventsource?
